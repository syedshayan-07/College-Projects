# College-Projects
This repository contains my first data analysis project, where I worked with a real-world weather dataset to understand and explore different atmospheric conditions. The dataset includes information such as date and time, temperature, apparent temperature, humidity, wind speed, wind direction, visibility, cloud cover, precipitation type, and atmospheric pressure.
The main goal of this project was to learn the basics of data analysis, including data cleaning, organizing raw data, and performing exploratory analysis. I analyzed how different weather parameters vary over time and how they relate to each other. Simple statistical methods and visual observations were used to identify trends and patterns in the dataset.
This project helped me gain hands-on experience with handling datasets, understanding weather-related variables, and drawing meaningful insights from data. As my first project, it reflects my learning journey in data analysis and serves as a foundation for more advanced projects in the future.
